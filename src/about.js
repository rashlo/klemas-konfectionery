				<p className="about-desc">Klema's Konfectionery is exactly that! That being a confectionery created by me Bibi Acklema(Klema) Lochan.
																	<br />
																	My team and I specialize in sweets and baked goods that are as appealing to the eyes as they are to the tastebuds.
															{/* <br />
																	Although my team and I are an order-only business and do not own a traditional store front, we are in turn able to offer our products at an economical price. */}
																	<br />
																	We offer a range of treats for all types of sweet-tooths. Want a little crunch? We have it! Something moist and cakey? We have it!  
																	<br />
																	Whatever treat you choose my team and I hope you enjoy our creations</p>
